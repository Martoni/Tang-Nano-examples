@W: MT529 :"c:\fpga\tang-nano-examples\nano\src\lcd_psram.v":131:0:131:5|Found inferred clock GATED_CLK|clkout_inferred_clock which controls 16 sequential elements including lcd0.spi_buf_in_high[7:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
